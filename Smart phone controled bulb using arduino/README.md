Smartphone Controlled Bulb using Arduino Uno, HC-06 Bluetooth Module, and 5V 1 Channel Relay Module
2.1 Introduction
This chapter focuses on the implementation of a smartphone-controlled bulb using Arduino Uno, an HC-06 Bluetooth module, and a 5V 1 channel relay module. The project demonstrates how Arduino can be utilized to create simple yet effective IoT solutions for home automation.
2.2 Project Overview:
This project aims to create a smartphone-controlled bulb using an Arduino Uno R3, a Bluetooth module, and a 5V 1-channel relay module. By connecting the components and writing the necessary code, you'll be able to control the bulb wirelessly from your smartphone.
2.3 Components Needed:
	Arduino Uno R3
	Bluetooth module (e.g., HC-05 or HC-06)
	5V 1-channel relay module
	Lightbulb/socket
	Jumper wires
	Smartphone with Bluetooth capability
	Arduino IDE installed on your computer
2.4 Circuit Connection:
Connect Bluetooth Module to Arduino Uno:
VCC to 5V pin GND to GND pin TX to RX pin (pin 0) RX to TX pin (pin 1)
Connect Relay Module to Arduino Uno:
VCC to 5V pin GND to GND pin
IN to any digital pin (e.g., pin 2)
Connect the relay's NO (Normally Open) and COM (Common) terminals to the bulb/socket.
Connect the Bulb:
 Connect one terminal of the bulb to the Common (COM) pin of the relay. Connect the other terminal of the bulb to the power source.
2.5 Steps to Implement:
1.	Bluetooth Module Setup:
•	Connect the Bluetooth module (HC-05 or HC-06) to the Arduino Uno as per the wiring diagram.
•	Pair the Bluetooth module with your smartphone. The default Bluetooth name is usually "HC-05" or "HC-06" and the default passcode is usually "1234" or "0000".
 
2.	Relay Module Setup:
•	Connect the 5V relay module to the Arduino Uno as per the wiring diagram.
•	Connect the bulb to the relay module.
3.	Upload the Arduino Code:
•	Open the Arduino IDE, copy the provided code, and upload it to your Arduino Uno.
4.	Control the Bulb via Smartphone:
•	Download and install a Bluetooth terminal app on your smartphone (e.g., "Bluetooth Terminal HC-05").
•	Open the Bluetooth terminal app and connect to the HC-05 or HC- 06 Bluetooth module.
•	Send the command '1' to turn ON the bulb and '0' to turn OFF the bulb.
2.6 Smartphone App:
You'll need an app on your smartphone that can send data over Bluetooth. You can either create a custom app using platforms like MIT App Inventor or use existing apps like " Bluetooth terminal app " from the Play Store for Android devices.
2.7 How It Works:
•	The Arduino listens for commands via the Bluetooth module.
•	When it receives '1', it turns on the relay, which completes the circuit for the bulb, turning it on.
•	When it receives '0', it turns off the relay, turning off the bulb.
2.8 Notes:
•	Make sure to power the Arduino and relay module properly.
•	Double-check the wiring to avoid any short circuits.
•	Ensure your Bluetooth module is paired with your smartphone before trying to control the bulb.
